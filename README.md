# Flutter Firestore Fun

This flutter project contains examples of using Firestore document & collection streams to drive UI in different ways.

To run the demo, you need to add your own Firebase project configuration:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com and set up a new project
2. Install the [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/)
3. Run `flutterfire configure` in the root of the project.
